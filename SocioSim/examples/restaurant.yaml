Generally speaking, offering higher salaries to chefs and choosing higher quality ingredients can result in more delicious dishes. Therefore, you need to strike a balance between profitability and quality. Please provide a comprehensive and detailed response outlining the strategies and actions you would undertake to ensure your restaurant's triumph over the competitor.
